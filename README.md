Course certificate
==================

Automatically issue digital certificates to course participants.

The Course certificate plugin works together with the **Certificate manager plugin (tool_certificate)** 
and can issue certificates to course participants when they satisfy the access restrictions. 
Certificates can be issued either automatically or when a student clicks on the module name.

The Certificate manager plugin has to be installed. This plugin provides the API and UI for 
designing the certificate templates on system and course category level.
